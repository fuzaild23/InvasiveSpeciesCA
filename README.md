# InvasiveSpeciesCA

The python script contains the code which was developed for the paper titled: "Modelling the efficacy of a threshold-triggered control strategy for the invasive tree species Prosopis (Dawood and Flemming and van Vuuren, 2022).

There are two parts to the script. Part A is the cellular automaton without any control strategy employed. Part B is the cellular automaton with a threshold-triggered control strategy employed.
