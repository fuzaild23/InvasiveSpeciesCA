# InvasiveSpeciesCA

The python script contains the code which was developed in the paper titled: "Modelling the efficacy of a threshold-triggered control strategy for the invasive tree species Prosopis (Dawood and Flemming and van Vuuren, 2022).

There are two parts to the script. Part A is a cellular automaton simulation without a control strategy employed. Part B is a cellular automaton simulation with a threshold-triggered control strategy employed.
